    "transcript": "Alice: Thanks for joining, everyone. Today, we're kicking off the AI-powered knowledge management system project. Our goal is to discuss key tasks and assign responsibilities. Bob: Sounds great. I think the first step is to define the core features and user requirements. Charlie: Agreed. We should also decide on the tech stack early to avoid rework later. Dana: I'll take the lead on gathering user requirements. I'll have an initial report ready by March 14th. Alice: Perfect. Bob, could you handle setting up the repository and initial project structure by March 10th? Bob: Absolutely, I'll get that done. Charlie: Once Bob sets up the repo, I can start working on the backend API structure. Alice: That works. Let’s also make sure we document everything properly. Dana: I can create a shared document for that so everyone can contribute. Bob: Good idea. I’ll also add a README with initial setup instructions. Alice: Awesome. Our next check-in will be next Friday. Let’s aim to have updates ready by then."
